				<strong>Got Junk?</strong> Well Joe certainly does, and a whole lot of it! Clutter has returned with
				something old,
				something new, something borrowed and something blue. If you've never played Clutter, <strong>this game
					will
					blow your mind</strong>, <em>yea, it's that good,</em> and we Clutter fans can't seem to get enough
				of this junk.
